# Next-Electron Starter Kit 🚀

This Next-Electron Starter Kit provides you with a solid foundation to build cross-platform desktop applications using Next.js and Electron. With this starter kit, you can quickly set up your development environment and focus on building your application's features.

## Features ✨✨

- **Next.js Integration**: Combines the power of Next.js for building React applications with Electron for desktop capabilities.
- **Electron**: Harness the full potential of Electron to create desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
- **IPC Communication**: Utilize Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to facilitate communication between the main process and renderer processes.
- **Notifications**: Implement native desktop notifications using the Electron Notification API.
- **Dialogs**: Use Electron's dialog module to display native system dialogs for opening files, saving files, and more.
- **Tray Icon**: Create a system tray icon for your Electron application, providing quick access and notifications to users.
- **Global Shortcuts**: Register global shortcuts to perform specific actions within the application, enhancing user experience.
- **Native Theme**: Utilize Electron's nativeTheme API to detect and respond to changes in the system's light or dark mode.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)

This will launch both the Next.js development server and Electron, allowing you to work on your application.

## Usage 🚦

- **Development**: During development, you can make use of hot reloading and other Next.js development features by running the `npm run dev` command.
- **Production Build**: To build your application for production, use the following command:

This will generate optimized build files in the `out` directory.

- **Run Electron App**: After building the application, you can run the Electron app using the following command:

## Additional Configuration ⚙️
